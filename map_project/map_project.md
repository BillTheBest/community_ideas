### Passively Measure Community Efforts

Measuring developer evangelism and other types of developer focused community building has been a hot topic for years. It’s really hard to do without getting in the way of the event because getting community builders to capture data in real time means that they probably aren’t focusing the bulk of their time on the event at hand.

At the same time we have access to lots of data that’s being captured and going largely unused. We know the data and location of every signup, customer, and we know where and when our events happen.

This project will put all of this information on one map and associate the events to signups via a point and click interface. Not only will it help us see the effect of our in person events it will inform us where we have customer density but haven’t had any events yet. Helping target the best places to schedule things and letting us know what events are having the most effect.
